# Assembly-Exercises
## A86
In this project, I have implemented an A86 assembly language program that takes input postfix expression involving hexadecimal quantities and evaluates it.
## MIPS
MIPS code practice
## CPU12 
The CPU12 instruction set is a proper superset of the M68HC11 instruction set, and M68HC11 source code is accepted by CPU12 assemblers with no changes.
